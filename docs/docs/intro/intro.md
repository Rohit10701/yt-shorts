# Welcome to AutoShorts

AutoShorts is a fully fledged framework that generates shorts videos with the help of AI to write the script. It can generate popular types of video seen on YouTube Shorts and TikTok.

If you want to support the development of this package, consider buying me a coffee:

<!-- # How does it work?
// Make mermaid diagram here. AutoShorts has Next.js UI, CLI template, and JS interface. The JS interface is the core of the package and can be used to generate videos programmatically. When generating video from JSON data or JSON data created by AI - which can be the OpenAI, Google Gemini, Antropic Claude, or Ollama. After JSON data, the code generate the voices with ElevenLabs, Neets.ai, or local TTS. The code also generate images with Pexels or Scraper. The code then combine the voices and images to create the video. Depending on video type, the code can generate different types of videos like text-to-speech, topic-based, text message story, 'Would you rather', ranking item, and more. The code can also generate different types of videos like news-related, educational, fun facts, and more. The code can be extended to include more types and tools internally. A canvas-like interface is used to create the graphics for the video. Animations and transitions are created with gl transistions. After voice is generated, the code use whisper to convert video to text for subtitle. All of this combined with ffmpeg to create the final video. -->

# Introduction

The package is built with a flexible abstraction layer which allows you to quickly create different types of videos with different AI tools and can be easily extended to include more types and tools internally.

This repo includes a CLI interface and JS interface. The CLI interface is built on top of the JS interface. The JS interface is the core of the package and can be used to generate videos programmatically.

:::note

This package is in the early stages of development and may have bugs - especially when interacting with AI to generate scripts. This package is not meant to be used in production environments yet. Since AI output is unpredictable, work is being done to make the output more predictable and controllable. If the AI generates an incorrect JSON output, then you can manually edit the JSON output to fix the issue. This package is subject to change and may have breaking changes in the future. Use at your own risk.

# Features
You can generate popular types of short videos seen on YouTube Shorts and TikTok like:
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) videos
- Topic-based videos with images
- Text message story videos
- 'Would you rather' videos
- Ranking item videos
- And more...

The topic-based video type can be used to generate videos on a wide range of topics like:
- News-related videos
- Educational videos
- Fun facts videos
- And more...

| Text Message Video | News Video | Quiz Video | Rank Video | Would You Rather Video |

You can request new video types and tools to be added to the package by creating an issue on the GitHub repo.

# Installation

Note: By default, the package use Ollama to generate scripts. Therefore a working Ollama installation is required. It is recommended to use the `llama3.2` model for best results. 

You can install this model by running the following command: `ollama pull llama3.2`. 

Using other local models may result in incorrect output.

You can use other AI APIs such as OpenAI ChatGPT 4o, Google Gemini AI, and Anthropic Claude by providing the necessary API keys and setting the `aiType` parameter to the appropriate value.

# Ultimate Goal

The goal of this package is move away from short video generation to a more general video generation framework that can generate videos of any length and type. This package is a stepping stone to that goal. If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to create an issue on the GitHub repo. Also any financial support is greatly appreciated.
